    <!--Social Responsibility -->
    <string name="SocialResponsibility">What is Social Responsibility?</string>
    <string name="SocialResponsibility1">Remember that you and others have the right to abstain from alcohol.
    If you do choose to drink, please do so responsibly.</string>

    <string name="DrinkAndDrive">Do Not Drink and Drive</string>
    <string name="DrinkAndDrive2">Do not allow an intoxicated person to drive. If the event you are attending does not provide sober a driver, appoint someone from your group of friends as the sober driver.
        Some bars will provide free soft drinks to designated driver.
        Remember to take turns being the designated driver.</string>

    <string name="KnowYourLimit">Know Your Limit and Stay Within It</string>
    <string name="KnowYourLimit2">Alcohol affects each person differently.
        Factors include gender, body weight, mood, amount of food eaten, and alcohol tolerance.
        The rate at which you drink is also a big factor. Generally, our bodies can metabolize one drink per hour.
        Avoid gulping and guzzling! Party games which encourage excessive consumption are never a good idea.</string>

    <string name="DoNotCombine">Do Not Combine Alcohol with Other Drugs or Medications</string>
    <string name="DoNotCombine2">Alcohol is a depressant. When combined with other depressant medications or drugs, a cumulative effect can occur.
        Dangerous side effects can include cessation of breathing.
        Even over-the-counter medications such as cold remedies can be dangerous when taken with alcohol.</string>
